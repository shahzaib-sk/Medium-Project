A **static, non-responsive clone** of Medium's interface, built purely with HTML and CSS. This project focuses on replicating Medium's core visual design (not functionality) for learning purposes.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is **not a production-ready website** and lacks responsiveness, interactivity, and backend features.
