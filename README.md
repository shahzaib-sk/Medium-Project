![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-yellow) ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?logo=css3&logoColor=white)

A **static, non-responsive clone** of Medium's interface, built purely with HTML and CSS. This project focuses on replicating Medium's core visual design (not functionality) for learning purposes.

⚠️ **Note**: This is **not a production-ready website** and lacks responsiveness, interactivity, and backend features.
